# Shrinefinder v2 Proposal

<img src="/app/assets/images/shrinefinderrb.svg" alt="Shrinefinder Logo" width="175"> 

Shrine Finder is a web application designed for tourists in Japan to discover lesser-known shrines off the beaten path. The app provides detailed information about each shrine, including unique features, associated deities, and available lucky charms (omamori) or shrine seals/calligraphy (goshuin). Users are able to leave comments/reviews. 

This version is built using Ruby on Rails and will offer an improved interface, new features, and a more robust backend compared to its earlier version built with JavaScript/React.

*There are estimated to be around 80,000 shrines in Japan. - wiki*

## Features
- Browse a database of shrines with detailed descriptions, images, and historical information.
- Filter and search shrines by location, deities, and features.
- View user reviews and ratings for each shrine.
- Submit your own reviews and comments on shrines.
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop users.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Rails with integrated ERB templates and Sass for styling.
- **Backend**: Ruby on Rails with SQLite database.
- **APIs**: Custom API endpoints for shrine data retrieval / TBD
